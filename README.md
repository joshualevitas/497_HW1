# Tasks

## 1. FFNN

[Please describe how you organized and used the datasets provided, the operation of your FFNN and hyper-parameter settings. Present the learning curves for training and test perplexity, and report Fakes Detection results in a confusion matrix with labeled axes. Please discuss any limitations of your approach and possible solutions. Please do not exceed one page for this.]



## 2. LSTM

[Please describe how you organized and used the datasets provided, the operation of your LSTM LM and hyper-parameter settings. Present the learning curves for training and test perplexity, and report Fakes Detection results in a confusion matrix with labeled axes. Please discuss any limitations of your approach and possible solutions. Please do not exceed one page for this.]


## 3. Results

[Results (10 pts): Use your best model to perform Fakes Detection on the Blind dataset, which consists of 500 unlabeled observations. You may also construct you own non-neural model. A simple rules- based approach may be effective -- working with incongruent dates is one approach. Please provide a.csvfilecontainingyour[REAL]or[FAKE]labelsforeachobservation. Iplantosharesummary results for each group with the class. Discuss how you selected your model, any limitations and possible solutions. Please do not exceed 1‚ÅÑ2 of a page for this.]
